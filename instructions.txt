DEMOGRAPH: INTERACTIVE COUNTY DEMOGRAPHICS VISUALIZATION
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

DemoGraph is an interactive web application that visualizes United States 
county-level demographic data on an interactive map. The application allows 
users to explore demographic statistics, compare counties, and analyze 
demographic trends across the United States.

The application provides a rich, data-driven exploration tool for 
demographers, researchers, policy makers, and anyone interested in 
understanding the demographic composition of U.S. counties.

================================================================================

- TopoJSON for geographic data format
- Vite (v7.1.12) as development server and build tool

Data Sources:
- U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates (2022)

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Common Issues:

1. Map not loading:
   - Check that us-states.json and us-counties.json are in /public folder
   - Verify browser console for errors

2. No demographic data showing:
   - Check demographics.json file exists
   - Try double-clicking county to fetch fresh data
   - Verify API key is set correctly (if using)

3. Search not working:
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify counties data has loaded

4. API fetch failures:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify API key is valid (if using)
   - Check Census API status
   - See API_SETUP.md for CORS solutions

5. Slow performance:
   - Some operations (like income histogram) process all counties
   - Large datasets may take a moment to render
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs
